									<h1>IT Technologies:</h1>
									<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

								<h2>WHAT DOES IT DO?</h2>
								<p>Machine learning is the process of teaching A.I to make accurate predictions through algorithms automatically without the need of programming it. Machine learning has huge potential, it can predict massive sets of data accurately if utilised correctly. Some examples of machine learning in the real world are self-driving cars, email spam detectors and ads being targeted based on searches. In machine learning the A.I are “trained” by training data to get them to identify patterns more consistently and accurately. The more training data there is the more the A.I will make accurate and consistent predictions. The state of machine learning is near the beginning, the potential of machine learning has been discovered by the general public in the recent years.</p>
								<p>This has increased its popularity immensely; however, we still have a long way to go even after all of the recent discovery and leaps made. Autonomous vehicles have advanced quite a bit to companies such as Yandex successfully creating prototypes and testing them in public roads in various countries to test the versatility. Also, machine learning can also be used to detect crop disease and yield, researchers Pennsylvania State University and the École Polytechnique Fédérale of Lausanne, Switzerland have created a program the classifies images of crops and identifies plant disease. It can also record the current yield the crops have; this is revolutionary in the agriculture industry that affects everyone. Based on this in the near future of 3 years minor improvements and miracle breakthroughs may happen in machine learning.</p>
								<p>Three years isn’t enough to make massive strides in this industry, at least twenty is needed to see fully autonomous vehicles or medical classifying machines that can predict your issues with your symptoms and images. But in three years minor breakthroughs may happen in autonomous vehicles which improve the distance travelled with little to no disengagements. Also, we can see machine learning used in the pharmaceutical industry as research and eventually manufacturing, DeepMind made a program called AlphaFold. An expert in the panel elaborated “The ability to accurately predict protein structures from their amino-acid sequence would be a huge boon to life sciences and medicine. It would vastly accelerate efforts to understand the building blocks of cells and enable quicker and more advanced drug discovery.” AlphaFold was deemed by Janet Thornton a structural biologist that this problem could not be solved within her lifetime. AlphaFold can help make sense of the disease-causing gene variations that differ between people and possibly fox them. Machine learning </p>

								<h2>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT?</h2>
								<p>Machine learning can and will impact numerous industries. The impact of machine learning depends on its development. If machine learning is developed for the next 20 years, we’ll see it take over jobs, make cars autonomous, detect and produce solutions for medical problems, effect our farms and even produce medical drugs. Machine learning can change the world with enough development, however some jobs will be lost and made redundant. Machine learning can be used to teach robots, thus making manual jobs and factory jobs redundant. While it gets rid of jobs that can be replaced with technology and automated robots, it can also bring in a lot of jobs relating to the IT industry. Specifically, data scientists, data scientists produce and maintain machine learning models, so they are needed to continue to innovate the world with machine learning. Machine learning will impact the working class the most. Blue collar workers would be affected tremendously with there jobs being automated and taken with machine learning and the development of new technology; this will make hundreds of thousands of jobs redundant causing massive backlash globally. Although many people will be affected negatively, many people will be affected positively with improved quality of life and lives being saved from medical breakthroughs as the accuracy and consistency of machine learning A.I are extremely high if modelled properly with massive amounts of training date. However, if we’re speaking of machine learning development in the next three years, nothing much will happen.  Development of machine learning in three years won’t have any global or notable industry impacts. At most small breakthroughs and improvements may happen with self-driving cars, agriculture industry and medical imaging machine learning.</p>

								<h2>HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?</h2>
								<p>In my daily life machine learning wouldn’t seem to help with anything at the current state of development as everything machine learning is relatively implemented in is in niche industries such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture. The only time it will affect me in my daily life if I take IT as a career, as machine learning is growing in popularity in the IT field and is seen as “The Future of IT”, when my career starts, I will probably run into multiple discussions of using machine learning in any IT career I choose to partake in. My friends and family will also not be affected at all as none of them is in the IT industry. However, if this were twenty years into the future, my friends and family would have their jobs be made redundant as most of them are blue collar workers which machine learning would take over with automation. Also, my day-to-day life would be different as I would most likely have a self-driving car and possibly use machine learning in my line of work. Also, I would most likely have a higher life expectancy as machine learning fast-tracked medical research and diagnosis, which also increases the life expectancy of my friends and family. Machine learning isn’t very popular right now, but in the very near future it can change the world.</p>

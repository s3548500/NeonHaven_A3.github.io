									<h2>1.Game Graphics Designer</h>
									<h3>Job Description</h3>
									<p>The animator people are responsible for creating the visual images included in the game. They create sketch plot synopsis boards to visualize the story from start to finish before starting work.</p>
									<h3>Skills</h3>
									<p>3D Animation, Animation, C++, Java, and other programming languages, Colour Theories, Cinematography, Computer Graphics, Digital Media, Drawing, Game Design, Gaming Tools and Technologies, Modelling.</p>
									<h3>Qualifications and experience needed:</h3>
									<p>Bachelor’s in game art and design, a bachelor’s in game software development, a bachelor’s in game design and Development, and a Master's Degree in Game Design. At least three years of work experience.</p>
									<p>For a game production company, a game graphics designer is essential. He is the foundation of the whole project. Designers must create all the dimensions that users encounter while playing the game. After developing the idea and concept of the story, he needs to create a system that responds to all the possible actions the user may take during the game. Video game design usually requires one to be creative as it requires multiple prototypes to understand what works and what should not include.</p>
									<p>This stage can be lengthy as all the features of the game need to be perfected. The video game designer also needs to meet a predetermined production schedule. Video game designers are creative and ideal for those with problem-solving skills. However, good communication skills are a requirement, and designers need to work with other departments such as programmers and audios engineers. Only when every department works together can we get a satisfactory product.</p>

									<h2>Software Developer and Game Programmer</h>
									<h3>Job Description</h3>
									<p>Game Programmers write the code that makes video games come to life. They work closely with the producer and other departments (game design, sound, etc.) to translate the project's vision into a fully functional, playable game.</p>
									<h3>Skills</h3>
									<p>Solid knowledge of a programming language/s (C++, Java, etc.), Experience with engines (Unreal Engine, Unity, etc.), Excellent communication skills, Strong math, problem solving and analytical skills.</p>
									<h3>Qualifications and experience needed:</h3>
									<p>Bachelor of information technology or Bachelor of computing. Master of information technology. At least three years of work experience.</p>
									<p>The games company is responsible for all levels of game design, from the conceptualization to the factory finished product. Each department plays its specific role, with all the moving parts working in tandem to ensure a seamless gaming experience for the player. Game developers play one of the principal roles, as they are the ones who transform the game designer's ideas into real, playable video games.</p>
									<p>The more technical aspects of game design will see them using programming languages and 'engines' to enhance gameplay. Developers design the software that makes the game work how the designers envisaged. At the same time, programmers use problem-solving skills to create code that translates the game designers' ideas into instructions that the video game system can read.</p>

									<h2>Audio programmers</h>
									<h3>Job Description</h3>
									<p>Audio programmers are skilled coders and specialize in implementing audio and music into video game engines. Sound collection, editing and creation of sound effects, ambient effects, and music for video games.</p>
									<h3>Skills</h3>
									<p>Audio APIs like FMOD, or Miles, DAWs, MIDI, Knowledge of C# or C/C++, Max/MSP, Software and tool development, Audio engineering (editing and mixing), Sound design.</p>
									<h3>Qualifications and experience needed:</h3>
									<p>Masters in Sound and Music Computing, at least three years of work experience.</p>
									<p>Audio programmers write the code that makes games sound fantastic. The sound of a game, including sound effects and music, is an integral part of the gaming experience. Audio programmers write scripts to determine functions such as volume and can make the player's movements trigger effects such as gunshots or footsteps. They are also responsible for developing software to integrate audio files into the game.</p>
									<p>After designing and creating new audio tools, they support programmers and designers in using them. They are also responsible for testing and debugging audio code. An excellent audio programmer should have good basic programming knowledge, a strong knowledge of DSP programming/Math/information and a passion for audio.</p>
									<p></p>

									<h2>Game Play Tester</h>
									<h3>Job Description</h3>
									<p>Game testers will find "bugs: or errors" in the video game so that the programmers can fix them before releasing the game to the public. Testers will repeat each level several times to try all options and report their findings to the development team.</p>
									<h3>Skills</h3>
									<p>Experience in playing video games. Clear and effective written & verbal communication skills.</p>
									<h3>Qualifications and experience needed:</h3>
									<p>Degree in game design, video graphics, computer programming, or another related field. At least three years of work experience. The job of a video game tester is not to play the game but to break it. They purposefully browse through the video game, play all the levels, navigate through all the menus, and use all the different characters and options to find flaws in the system. It is expected that video game testers will take various steps in the game to identify any bugs or glitches. Essentially, bugs are problems in programming and of which there can be many kinds. Errors occur when the player is trapped in a specific location or when a particular character's motion graphics do not work correctly.</p>
									<p>One of the main tasks that a tester does is to use the game in as many ways as possible and take actions that few users will do. Testers will try steps and games that the developers may not have thought of to find programming issues that can fix before release. This may sound time-consuming and repetitive, but it is an essential duty. Attention to detail is so important for testers because they will need to replicate all the bugs they find so that programmers can fix them. Reproducing the exact steps required to get to the problem site and producing a report is key.</p>

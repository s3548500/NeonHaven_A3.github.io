												<h3>Kelvin Tran</h3>
												<h3>Student ID: s3840940</h3>
												<p>Hi! My name is Kelvin Tran, and I was born in Melbourne, Australia with a Vietnamese background. I am currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University in 2021. My hobbies involve playing varieties of video games mainly shooting games and listening to music while taking my breaks. My interest in Information Technology started when using my first computer way back when I was very young. I say the IT experience I have is not a lot but does involve computer literacy skills when it comes to computers like Microsoft Office programs or operating system and programming skills like basic HTML and CSS for web design.</p>

												<h3>Jiyuan Wu</h3>
												<h3>Student ID: s3861895</h3>
												<p>My name is Jiyuan Wu, I come from China. And I am studying at RMIT as a student whose major is IT. My friends here call me Bruce. I like listening to music, playing games, and watching movies to relax myself. I also play some favourite sports like basketball and biking. I have kept many kinds of animals for pet, like birds, fish, turtles, etc. I wanted to keep a dog or a cat as my pet in the past, but the situation did not allow me to do so. Maybe I will have a dog someday in the future. I would like to call myself a gamer, games took a great part in my life in the past few years. I had played some games on computer, but mostly on the phone. I think these experiences of playing games may help me develop my own game in some way. (If I am considering building a game some day in the future.)</p>

												<h3>Qiurui Xu</h3>
												<h3>Student ID: s3548500</h3>
												<p>I am Qiurui Xu, from China. This is my final year in the bachelor’s degree at RMIT. Now, I am living in Melbourne. I think I could communicate with people from different cultural backgrounds. In addition, I can understand their meanings and avoid communication barriers due to weakness in language. I am highly collectivist. Being high in collectivism means that I could be a good team member when working with others in a group project. My hobby is playing games on the internet or via those mobile terminals. I like playing games because it is a pretty good way for me to relax and enjoy my free time. This is because in real life, we are usually busy with study or work and are highly stressed. A high level of stress is destructive for our mental and physical health. I am also a bit introverted. So, to lessen the high level of stress from learning, I would like to play games online.</p>

												<h3>Yicheng Lu</h3>
												<h3>Student ID: s3906527</h3>
												<p>I am Yicheng Lu, you can also call me Dave. I have been studying in Australia for 6 years since my family migrated to Australia and I am currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. This is my first year in university, I choose to study Information Technology because it is an interesting field and RMIT is a very formal university in this area. Because I am new to this area it opens a fantastic window of the world of IT as learning itself is interesting. Information Technology helps people to understand and build the communication channel with the digital world. IT is also a technology which is always creative and keeps innovation as the time pass. It also provides huge range of my career development. I would like to study cloud computing, cyber security, and data analysis. I have a range of hobbies includes cycling, esport and terrarium care.</p>

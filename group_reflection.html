									<h2>Kemal Dogru</h2>
									<h3>1. What went well?</h3>
									<p>The development of the game went well under the time limitations we had, I expected us to have barely any progress done. The game will have a fully functonal prototype for the presentation due Friday.</p>
									<h3>2. What could be improved?</h3>
									<p>Everyone just needs to communicate and attend meetings together, this little act can solve all the groups problems.</p>
									<h3>3. At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
									<p>The development of the game was very surprising as I was expecting us to fail and not make any progress, but thanks to Kelvins expertise we got the work done.</p>
									<h3>4. At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h3>
									<p>Groups are hard to function when no one is passionate or dejected about the project. I believe as the project seemed “difficult” and “impossible”, some group members lost the passion and drive to work on the project, so they stopped caring.</p>

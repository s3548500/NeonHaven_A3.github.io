									<h2>Topic</h2>
									<p>In this project, Neon Haven is making a game with the title called “Soul Companion”. Soul Companion is a freeware side-scrolling game which involves elements of exploration and puzzles, where it follows a player waking up in a mysterious apocalyptic world set hundred years into the future where you are the last human alive. From the player’s perspective this can be seen unknowingly to them as they have no knowledge of any humans existing to begin with or what timeline they are in. This game can be seen as having no narrative been told, but you are free to develop your own perspectives of what happened to this empty world.</p>
									<p>Soul Companion does not involve any dangerous type of elements such as fighting, killing or dominations at its core gameplay. You are to guide the player through this world and explore to your heart’s content in an unknown land or maybe somewhat familiar areas that only you, but not the player, would know of? You can enjoy this game at your own pace without any sort of consequences happening to you or the player.</p>

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p>As a group, we all enjoy playing games one way or another and that this could be a learning experience as to how game developers make games interesting to the eyes of the players while presenting to his/her co-worker. Although each group member has their own type of job that they want to pursue, in the face of a future employer, it will show that we are capable of working together to meet end-goals and that as a creative person, we want to have our ideas become reality.</p>

									<h2>Landscape</h2>
									<p>I would say that there are many pixel retro style games that combine exploration and puzzle elements with other game types such as The Legend of Zelda or Metroid are prime examples. I am unaware of any specific competitors out there that would extremely be compared to our small project. Normally our game could just be seen as an animation rather than just be created as a game, however what I want to pursue is a game that you could explore and have the option to go back one stage (or possibly all stages) and maybe explore a different route that was left hidden. Our project could be seen as an Indie game since it’s not backed by any one who is truly professional and that there are a lot of indie games out there that become successful or not become successful, that is, game developers do learn or gain experience out of it. However our team goal is just to create a game that anyone could enjoy regardless of the state of the game.</p>

									<h3>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</h3>
									<p>While there were some circumstances in trying to pull the team together, I believe everyone contributed in their respective roles. Everyone attended most of the meetings and were able to gain some kind of knowledge and feedback or assistance.</p>

									<h2>Alex Strates</h2>
									<h3>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</h3>
									<p>My group worked fantastic together and were effective and efficient in communication and completing their tasks. My communication and completion of work weighed the group down and I felt that I did not attempt the set tasks at the fullest of my abilities, something that I will strive for in assignment 3</p>

									<h2>Jiyuan Wu</h2>
									<h3>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</h3>
									<p>There are some unexpected accidents, but overall my group is doing well. Every member contributes to the group by completing their parts of work. And I can see necessary communications and cooperations between our team members. Looking forward to our next assignment to see how we work then.</p>

									<h2>Yicheng Lu</h2>
									<h3>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</h3>
									<p>I completed my part of the group work per the team’s schedule and provided my output on time. Our team worked well and always kept unity and had good communication with everyone in the team. Since I am a new student in RMIT I have learned  more from the team and I am happy with the team working together and learning more.</p>
									<hr class="major" />
								
									<h2>Changes in process for Assignment 3</h2>
									<p>I doubt there will be any huge changes to the group other than more meetings scheduled all the way to the due date. Work will be divided equally to ensure that everyone contributes to the assignment at their best capabilities.</p>
